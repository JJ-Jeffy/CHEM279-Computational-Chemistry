Hello, 
This is my Final Project submission. I did make some of the changes that were mentioned during class, and things seem to get better a little bit so thank you. 
Changes I made:
1) I have changed my hessian calculation function so you can see that I used the gradient this time to calculate the hessian
2) I also used optimized coordinates, this did not seem to help as much
3) To debug, I installed python's numdifftool and used that to see if I can get some sort of accuracy in my code
4) I also realize that maybe part of the reason why my results don't match experimental results is because maybe the lennard jones potential parameters of sigma and epsilon that I used are not proper for this case.

Overall, thank you so much for all of your help. This was a very fun exericse. Have a lovely winter break :)
